# SMDIF Database Documentation

## Project Overview
The SMDIF Database project is designed to manage and document vital information regarding citizen services, particularly in responding to social issues. This includes comprehensive tracking of service interactions, demographic data, and eligibility for various programs. The documentation covers the database schema, table relationships, fields, and sample queries for user guidance.

## Installation
To install and run the SMDIF Database project, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/smdif-database.git
   cd smdif-database
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   Create a database using your preferred SQL database management system and run the database schema setup scripts provided in the project.

## Usage
To utilize the SMDIF Database functionalities, you can connect to the database and run SQL queries as needed. Make sure you have the correct permissions and have granted access to the necessary tables.

### Sample Queries
Here are some example queries to demonstrate possible usage:
```sql
-- Get all services for a citizen
SELECT * FROM all_tables WHERE CURP = 'CURP_VALUE';

-- Program eligibility report
SELECT p.*, ps.puntaje_total 
FROM personas p
JOIN programas_sociales ps ON p.CURP = ps.CURP
WHERE ps.puntaje_total > 50;
```

## Features
- Comprehensive citizen service history tracking.
- Scoring system for program eligibility.
- Case status and progress tracking.
- Built-in demographic analysis tools.
